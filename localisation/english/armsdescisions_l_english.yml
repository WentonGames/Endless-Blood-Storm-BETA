######################EVENTS
 armsmarket.1.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Requests Light Tanks"
 armsmarket.1.desc:0 "Officials from [FROM.GetNameDef] have approached us with a stated desire to purchase light tanks from our nation. Expressing awe for what they called '[ROOT.GetAdjective] genius' and 'excellence in design', [FROM.GetAdjective] officials have relayed to us that [FROM.GetNameDef] simply must have [ROOT.GetAdjective] armor in order to safeguard their own sovereignty. This will divert our own production for a short period of time, but we will receive payment for the sale."
 armsmarket.1.a:0 "We shall send some of our finest!"
 armsmarket.1.b:0 "Send some of our more standard armored vehicles."
 armsmarket.1.c:0 "They may have some of our older models."
 armsmarket.1.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] will get absolutely nothing from us."
 armsmarket.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Sends Improved Light Tanks!"
 armsmarket.2.desc:0 "We have just received a shipment of [FROM.GetAdjective] tanks straight from their own factories! The armor is modern and early testing has shown them to be very versatile vehicles. They shall no doubt serve our armed forces well."
 armsmarket.2.a:0 "What an unexpected surprise!"
 armsmarket.3.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Sends Light Tanks"
 armsmarket.3.desc:0 "We have just received a shipment of [FROM.GetAdjective] tanks straight from their own factories! The light armor is a little dated but still rather robust according to our quality tests. They shall no doubt serve our armed forces well."

 armsmarket.4.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Gift Outmoded Armor"
 armsmarket.4.desc:0 "We have just received a shipment of [FROM.GetAdjective] tanks straight from their own factories! The armor is no doubt dated, and the [FROM.GetAdjective]s have likely retired the model given its many flaws. Regardless, our armed forces shall find a use for them... somehow."
 armsmarket.4.a:0 "If it was good enough for 1922, it is good enough for now!"
 armsmarket.5.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Send Us Nothing"
 armsmarket.5.desc:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective]s have refused to send us even a chassis from their oldest model. The [FROM.GetAdjective] armor is apparently for [FROM.GetAdjective] use only, and prominent figures in [FROM.GetNameDef] allegedy cited national security concerns as a reason not to provide any armor to us."
 armsmarket.5.a:0 "The tanks probably would have broken down anyways."
